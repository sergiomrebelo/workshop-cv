# Introduction to Computer Vision for Creative Coding
TThis repository contains data and code related to a workshop about the fundamentals of computer vision in the context of creative coding and the development of experimental interfaces, using the camera as a sensor. Participants will be introduced to computer vision using [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [P5.js](https://p5js.org/), along with the libraries [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), [Deep Vision](https://github.com/cansik/deep-vision-processing), and [ml5](https://ml5js.org/).

This workshop developed in the context of _Amazing Robots_ initiative, part of the [First Foundation Project](https://dei.uc.pt/FirstFoundation/), supported by [Feedzai](https://feedzai.com/) and [Department of Informatics Engineering](https://www.uc.pt/en/fctuc/dei/) of the University of Coimbra.

*Workshop date:* 1 July 2024, 17h--19h, Amazing Lab
