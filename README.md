# Introduction to Computer Vision for Creative Coding

This repository contains data and code related to a workshop on the fundamentals of computer vision in the context of creative coding and the development of experimental interfaces, using the camera as a sensor. Participants will be introduced to computer vision using [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [P5.js](https://p5js.org/), along with the libraries [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), [Deep Vision](https://github.com/cansik/deep-vision-processing), and [ml5](https://ml5js.org/).

This workshop is developed as part of the _Amazing Robots_ initiative, part of the [First Foundation Project](https://dei.uc.pt/FirstFoundation/), supported by [Feedzai](https://feedzai.com/) and the [Department of Informatics Engineering](https://www.uc.pt/en/fctuc/dei/) of the University of Coimbra.

**Workshop date:** 1 July 2024, 17:00-19:00, Amazing Lab  
**Lecturers:** Sérgio M. Rebelo and Jéssica Parente

## Workshop Contents
1. Live Video and Motion Sensing Devices
2. Software Mirrors
3. Video Tracking
4. Video Differencing
5. Face Detection and Contours
6. Object Detection
7. Neural Style Transfer

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Processing**: You need to have [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) installed on your computer. Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts.
- **Web Browser**: A modern web browser (_e.g._ Chrome, Firefox, Safari) should be installed for viewing web-based demos and applications.
- **Webcam**: A functional webcam is required for running real-time applications and demos that involve live video input.

Make sure these prerequisites are installed and properly configured on your system to ensure a smooth experience with the workshop materials.

## Repository Layout

This repository is organised into two main folders: **Boilerplates** and **Demos**.

### Boilerplates
The **Boilerplates** folder contains reusable code templates for various computer vision tasks using different libraries.

### Demos
The **Demos** folder contains examples of code templates exploring different computer vision tasks.
